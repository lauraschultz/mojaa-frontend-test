## Mojaa Frontend Challenge

Bare clone this server locally using the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/).

Create a public repository named `frontend-test` in your github account, and push the initial codebase to that repository.

Create a todo list application, with multiple categories, and a graph that displays the status of the todo list.

We've included [recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) as a dependency in this project, but you are free to use any charting library that you wish.

An example of the sort of state we want to reflect:

```
|---------------------|
|       Hiring        |
|---------------------|
| Speak to candidate X|
|---------------------|
|    Push role live   |
|---------------------|
|  Follw up interview |
|---------------------|

|---------------------|
|     Development     |
|---------------------|
|    Scope changes    |
|---------------------|
|Push database change |
|---------------------|
```

These can be designed as you wish - this is as much a reflection of your design capabilities as your programming capabilities.

## Development

To run the development server run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`, there are further, more detailed, instructions on initial page load.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) (use a free, no custom domain plan).

## Task Completion

Please email rory@mojaa.tech with a link to your project in a public GitHub repository on completion of the task.
